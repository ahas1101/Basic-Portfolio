            <p class="Box3">
                My name is Abdullahi Hassan. I was born in Mogadishu, Somali. <br>
                I came to United States when was 6 yearrs old and haven't went back. <br>
                I have liven in MN a place that is the complete opposiste of Mogadishu but its has become my home. <br>
                I donâ€™t think I would have had the same opportunities in life if I had stayed. <br>
                I went to Roosevekt high school in Minneapolis. <br>
                I started playing basketball, soccer, and every other sport you can think of i'm very activite.<br>
                However I'm food junkie. The deep love I have for food is unmatched <br>
                I would try try any food once if it isn't against my religion. What can you say, I love food.<br>
                However to maintain a healthy life i have my second love of sports or do something dreaded like workout.<br>
